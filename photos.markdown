# Shutter Clicks

Some times I take photographs, and in rarer times some of the better ones might end up here. Interested in my [gear?](/photo-gear/)

You can find more of my photos on [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshashby/) {% aside page. %}It's not well maintained by me at the moment, lagging behind by a few years, but it's got a lot of my earlier history.{% endaside %}

I've got one "professional" photo credit to my name so far as the last photo in:

- Redger, Ashlee. “Local Finds: Oso Rojo Hot Sauce Puts Flavor Before Spice” Westworld, 2 Dec. 2022, [https://www.westword.com/restaurants/oso-rojo-hot-sauce-15483836](https://www.westword.com/restaurants/oso-rojo-hot-sauce-15483836)

Most of these are of a ridiculously cute little dog named Chief. You've been
warned 🙂
