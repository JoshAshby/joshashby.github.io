      <p>This month has been pretty bad for me. <em>Nothing bad</em> <strong>actually</strong> happened: I'm
still alive with all limbs accounted for, but its just been very ... <em>off</em>.
Admittedly the other day didn't help: As I was driving into Boulder, doing my
usual daily Fort Collins to Boulder commute, my cars radiator went kaput. What
fun. I managed to get it into work, and thankfully a coworker followed me to
the shop and gave me a ride back to the office. The repair shop was wonderful
and accommodating as always (seriously, if you have a Subaru and are in the
Boulder area, <a href="http://www.superrupair.com/">Super Rupair</a> is amazing) and got
it all repaired plus some before the day was up.</p>
<p>Over all, I wouldn't call that <em>bad</em>, I mean, I still have my car, I have great
friends and the only thing I lost was some time and a few dollars. But
honestly, it took everything I had to not burst out bawling as I was getting a
lift to pick my car up. It's just one of those months where nothing is right,
everything is wrong and something is always broken for no good reason, and the
car was just the final dam breaking, releasing the flood that has been building
up throughout the month.</p>
<p>It is ... immensely difficult to describe, to explain, to even talk about. I
often find myself coming up dry with no words to even begin to comprehend this
feeling with. I only get more angry and confused when thinking about it, trying
to justify it, trying to understand it. It is also just as equally difficult to
escape.</p>
<p>The only thing that comes close to describing the veil is the feeling, that
primal instinct feeling, of something - just <em>something</em> - being wrong.. That
feeling of your life just not being correct, off. There isn't anything wrong,
nothing is incorrect. In nearly every sense of the word, the world is perfect.
But you aren't, you don't feel that way. You don't agree with everything being
perfect because something deep inside of you tells you something is wrong.</p>
<p>But there is nothing you can do to fix it. Nothing helps. Eating? Nothing.
Staying hydrated? Nothing. Exercise? Nothing. Nothing works. Not even sitting
at the same table during lunch as your crush. Not even having her strike up
conversation. Nothing.</p>
<p>Anything you try is useless. Pointless. Anything you do will result in a
fruitless expenditure of energy that will get you nowhere. Better give up now
while you still can; Maybe if you just sit here for a little long it'll all
work itself out. Anything that happens, any <em>hint</em> of stress, drives you
deeper. It digs into you, buries itself in the dark of your being and drags
you under.</p>
<p>By that same token, it weighs on your facade, that fake wall that everyone
interacts with. It begins to feel like everyone notices, like all eyes are on
you. It feels like someone has pointed the spotlight right at you, you're all
lit up against this dark, bleak blackness and you want to do is curl up in your
shell and wait out the storm.</p>

      <p>It comes and goes, like the cycles of the sun, something that is always there
in the background. A lot of days its pretty easy to ignore, to pretend its not
there, but sometimes it just really catches the better of you and you end up
getting dragged down.  And when that happens it's pretty hard to not notice it.</p>
<p>It's like ... standing in the open sun, wondering why all you see is the stars
and night sky. Really confusing, if you think about it.</p>
<p>When you get into these lulls its pretty hard to not think that you are
defective. That something, somewhere is just slightly off. Maybe a neuron isn't
calibrated correctly, or maybe one is missing or its connected backwards. You
try, <em>try</em> to think about all the things that could have caused this, looking,
desperately grasping for something to fix, something to pull you out of this.</p>
<p>Amazing friends always are a great help. They'll always talk to you and listen,
asking questions when they either don't understand something you said, or are
trying to get a better picture of what your saying. They're simply amazing and
will go to sometimes extreme measures to ensure you don't wander anywhere too
"not-that-good."</p>
<p>But you still feel broken. You still sit in the middle of your room crying your
eyes out because its the only thing you know how to do, and you don't even know
if it'll help or not. I honestly don't know how I haven't gone through more
boxes of kleenex this month because this has become an all too familiar scene.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, a lot of it is also self reinforcing. Once started, it just
keeps dragging you down, further and further. And a lot of it sparks off a
nasty flame of self-hatred as well.</p>

      <p>Admittedly, this is the part that I probably struggle with the most. While
dealing with the other crap, the feeling of loneliness, the worthlessness and
brokenness is incredibly difficult beyond words already, the self hatred really
digs into me, sinking its obsidian like blade ever further. I hate, absolutely
<strong>hate</strong> that I feel this way, and I think that its quite dumb and stupid. Its
useless to think that I'm broken, because obviously outside of my own little
brain everything in the world says I'm doing great and am absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>I get a lot of praise because I've done some really neat and awesome things
already, given that I'm only 22 years into this whole ordeal. Apparently thats
a pretty big deal, and its great that I have as much responsibility as I do
both in and out of work. But I really hate it when people tell me that.</p>
<p>Really, really hate it.</p>
<p>Why? Because I don't think I'm good enough to receive that praise, because I
don't think I deserve it because I just really hate my broken self. I don't
think I'm all that smart, I do a lot of stupid things and everything I've done
in the real world isn't anything ground breaking or new, just repeats of the
same old pattern thats been going on for decades before I was even born. So why
should I get praise if I don't think I deserve it?</p>
<p>Dealing with this, with myself, is perhaps the hardest and most difficult
challenge I've faced. And I've been facing it for a long while apparently too,
considering I found an old blog post from January of 2014, and another from
2013, talking about this same exact struggle.</p>
<p>I hate that I feel this way, small and insignificant, when I know full well
that I'm not. I hate that I feel down all the time and worthless, when at least
part of me knows I'm not. I hate that I hate that I feel this way. And thats a
really, extremely difficult process to reconcile with yourself. Some days it
feels like I'll never be able to come to terms with myself for this, and others
its 100% easy to ignore and not pay any attention to. But I always do end up
coming back to the question of why am I floundering like a fish out of water,
why is this so difficult for me to accept or work against? Why am I putting so
much friction between myself?</p>
<p>But it always ends in more questions ...</p>

      <p>As I said, this month hasn't been the best or easiest. I suppose part of it can
be attributed to the fact that the holidays just happened so I spent the last
two months listening to people tell others about how amazing I am, or people
asking me to talk about what I do only to be floored in amazement. There is
also the fact that admittedly I feel rather lonely. I've pushed a lot of
friends out of my life and only have a few left who are willing to sit around
and listen to my shit once in a while. They're pretty amazing but I feel
incredibly horrible for always seeming like the little drama queen half the
time because I'm trying to reconcile something with myself and don't know how
to handle it.</p>
<p>February doesn't help either, considering valentines day and all that. Its just
another reminder to myself on how awful my social skills are and how since I
don't do anything but sit around feeling sorry I haven't put any effort into
finding someone to actually enjoy life with. It also tends to serve as a nice
reminder of how small and insignificant I feel, when I see posts on facebook, a
random twitter message or hear someone mention something in person about
someone I was going to ask to coffee or on a date being in a relationship.
Those really do just kind of kick you to the dirt and add to the stress and
weight of the world.</p>
<p>It makes me feel tiny in comparison to everything around me, like a small ant
just wandering around without any real goal or purpose outside of surviving.
And it only adds to that self hatred, making me hate that I haven't gone out
and met new people, that I can't get out and date someone because I'm down in
this dumb, stupid rabbit hole.</p>
<p>And it makes me feel like the only one around, because I'm so small compared to
everything else that I can't see it ...</p>
