      <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This post contains spoilers about the book 'The Hydrogen Sonata'
by Iain M. Banks. Read at your own risk.</p>
<p>I just started, and promptly finished reading my first book for 2016: 'The
Hydrogen Sonata' by Iain M. Banks, and let me tell you: WOW. I'm now stuck in a
funk, trying to understand and wanting to live in the book. I wish it hadn't
ended and I selfishly wish it had a sequel.</p>
<p>TL;DR: 10/10 - Fantastic, funny, thought provoking, melancholic and serene.</p>
<p>(Cover image from <a href="http://www.orbitbooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HydrogenSonata_UK9.jpg">Orbit Books</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The story starts, following the Gzilt as they are preparing to enter the great
Enfolded; To Sublime and leave the Real world in order to live in an apparently
blissful place in the higher dimensions. This is, of course, all predicted in
their equivalent of a holy book, The Book of Truth.  Having been delivered from
a civilization called the Zhildren, who have long since Sublimed and left their
legacy to the Gzilt, The Book of Truth has correctly followed and predicted
each step along the way for over 10,000 years.</p>
<p>The whole affair is a rather sobering and melancholic as the whole civilization
of the Gzilt is preparing for this momentous event, and as other civilizations,
the Culture included, stop by to pay their last respects and make good on the
small lies or any secrets they'd been keeping all these years. The moment is
punctuated by the arrival of various Culture ships (including the largest GSV
<strong>Empiricist</strong>, to pay their own respect to the Gzilt who were part of the
founders for the Culture. However, because of The Book of Truth, the Gzilt
eventually decided not to join the Culture and went on their way, along side
their new cousin civilization.</p>
<p>There is only one small problem: The Book of Truth isn't <strong>actually</strong> True. Far
from it, in fact, as a small group discovers the book was actually a sort of
joke, a jest at a fellow scientist to prove some inexplicable point. In the
end, the Gzilt are nothing but an elaborate experiment. Thankfully nearly no
one knows this, except whats left of the Zhildren that didn't Sublime (referred
to as the Zhildren-Remnant or Z-R), who decide that they should probably make
clean on their people and tell the Gzilt.</p>
<p>What follows is something of pure luck it seems when a Culture ship, the Ue
(Unit, eccentric) <strong>Mistake Not ...</strong>, observes the unexplainable destruction
of the Z-R ship sent to relay the true Truth. As this happens, a subgroup of
the Gzilt military, the 14th Regiment, who are skeptical on the whole Subliming
issue recall one of their reserves, Vyr Cossont, to track down a man who was at
the beginning of it all. Older than the Culture itself, Ngaroe QiRia is perhaps
one of the only people left outside of the Z-R that knows the truth.</p>
<p>Following an attack on the 14ths HQ, we're thrown into a mass of parallel plot
lines; Vyr and her overly dramatic synthpet Pyan are rescued by the <strong>Mistake
Not ...</strong> who chooses to help Vyr with her mission. All the while the head of
the Gzilt political parties and the driver of the Subliming decision is working
to ensure that the truth doesn't get out, while other Culture ships start
working to track down QiRia on their own, all while trying to keep the
scavengers who have shown up to lay claim on whats left of the Gzilt
civilization at peace.</p>
<p>The end result? The <strong>Mistake Not ...</strong> having a dirty little firefight with
supporters of the head Gzilt politico resulting in the deaths of quite a few
Gzilt only days before they all get to "live forever" in the Sublime, including
the death of the <strong>Mistake Not ...</strong>'s avatar, Berdle. After this, the truth is
finally recovered and the Culture Minds decide what their next move should be:
tell the Gzilt or quietly keep it their own little secret until some future
time.</p>
<p>All of this begs the question: Why? Why do the Culture Minds seem to care so
much about uncovering the secret surrounding the origins of the Book of Truth,
to the point that they are willing to risk not only their own lives but those
of the biological beings they are entrusted with?</p>
<p>Its a light hearted, fun adventure to find the truth that turns into a rather
interesting moral question about whether the truth really should be known or
not, followed by the serene ending as the Gzilt complete their trip
into the Enfolded. The conversations between the Minds and other AIs are
humorous and interesting, and the over all plot is incredibly thought
provoking. To add to this, this book was, unfortunately, the last sci-fi book
that Banks wrote (published in Oct. 2012), before passing away from gall
bladder cancer in 2013.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> A rather somber, and fitting, end to the Culture
universe.</p>
<p>Anyways, since I'm pretty bad at writing book reviews heres just some general
thoughts, most of which are missing an end and trail off:</p>
<hr>
<p>Lets start with the obvious bit: The Hydrogen Sonata, from which the book draws
its name. This is an interesting commentary and a massive foreshadowing of the
entire plot. Its a piece of music that was composed as a bit of a joke: just
because it <strong>could</strong> be composed, didn't mean that it was anything special or
beautiful. In fact he hated it, saying that it was just to show how easy it
was to write.</p>
<p>But, at the same time its a piece of work that required a massive amount of
discipline to play properly. For many people it seems to take a lifetime. Oh
yeah, and its written for an instrument that requires 4 hands instead of the
normal two. Just a bit of a commitment, that is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh yes, the big R. This is an bit of an interesting topic in the Culture
universe. The Culture itself doesn't have a religion and in fact I don't
remember ever reading about large gatherings of religion inside of the
Culture, outside of maybe an orbital or star system.</p>
<p>But what is interesting, is that to me and indeed to a lot of the
galaxy, the Culture Minds are practically gods; Or as close as a physical
entity could be, at least. They are housed mostly in hyperspace, control
everything from drones to biological avatars to massive GSV scale ships and
Orbitals too. They have magical effector fields to manipulate the world,
displacers to rapidly move matter from one place to another, and hyperspace
engines to move across vast swatches of space in the blink of an eye all at
their disposal.</p>
<p>And with all of this, what do they choose to do? Meddle with the affairs of the
lesser beings around them. Its an interesting view, and a theme that is
repeated in all the culture books. While not the definition of a religion, I do
have to wonder how ship Minds would react to having their humans worship them
and raise them to deity status?</p>
<p>Also, having just read Surface Detail right before this, and seeing how the
Culture detests the notion of hells it was interesting to see the other side;
After all, Subliming feels an awful lot like the concept of Heaven to me.</p>
<hr>
<p>As the end of the Gzilt, as we know them, draws nearer the Minds are faced with
an interesting moral predicament. Knowing the truth about the fabric of the
Gzilt civilization, that The Book of Truth is a joke played out by the
Zhildren before the Gzilt had even invented space travel, what action should
the Minds take if any?</p>
<p>Its an interesting problem, because at what point does letting the truth be
known result in more harm than good?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Zoologist</strong> is an interesting little ship Mind. Once sublimed, it has
returned to the Real and taken up life in a small corner of the LOU <strong>Caconym</strong>,
although it proves to be unable to explain life as a sublimed. Mentioned only
a few times, <strong>The Zoologist</strong> seems to be a vestigial story line that was
forgotten until it came time to wrap up the book, according to quite a
lot of internet discussion on the book. But I've noticed that little side
stories like these tend to be sprinkled through a lot of the Culture books,
often to prove some small point. In this case? We don't actually know what lies
beyond, and there isn't really a way to comprehend it. The fact that <strong>The
Zoologist</strong> sublimed and then returned is in its own right a little confusing,
but the fact that it return, it itself a Culture Mind, completely baffled both
about life there and why it left, shows this simple fact. And let us not forget
that Culture Minds are practically like small gods in many senses.</p>
<p>Sure, Banks could have just said (and he did actually) "its really a difficult
place to know and understand" but no one believes that. I mean, hes the author!
He can make up whatever rules and experiences he wants to! But thats not
<strong>really</strong> the point though, is it?</p>
