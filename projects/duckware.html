<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Duckware is a QA and developers dream. It records events happening on a webpage, ranging from clicks to websocket data and network requests and allows packaging it up with timestamped screen recordings to send over to developers to help hunt bugs.



<p>Duckware is a new and evolving project for me, so this page should be considered
‚ÄúUnder Construction‚Äù as new features get built out and the extension gets more
polish.</p>

<p>Currently Duckware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logs network (including websocket frames) requests
    <ul>
      <li>It‚Äôll capture JSON request/response bodies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Logs user interactions with the recording webpage
    <ul>
      <li>Clicks, keyboard events, navigations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Logs console messages from the webpage</li>
  <li>Allows you to record multiple screen captures per session</li>
  <li>Saves the log and all screen captures into a zip that can be passed to
another Duckware user</li>
</ul>

<p>In Progress Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logging Worker and window.postMessage/onMessage events</li>
  <li>Better control over the screen capture, including audio muting</li>
  <li>Arbitrary file upload</li>
  <li>Loading/viewing reports generated by another Duckware user
    <ul>
      <li>Including play back of recorded user interactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
