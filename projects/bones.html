<p>I’ve slowly been using Fossil for more of my personal projects. The idea of the
self-contained nature of Fossil as well as the ease to host them remotely
appeals to me a lot, but I wanted a nice interface for creating and navigating to
the various repositories I’ve got. There’s already the great
<a href="https://chiselapp.com/">Chisel</a> but I enjoy reinventing wheels, and was
looking to build something which I could eventually integrate additional
tooling into, such as a CI/CD pipeline and centralized auth.</p>
