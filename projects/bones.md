**TL;DR** Bones is a small tool for managing remote [Fossil-SCM](https://fossil-scm.org/)
repositories, giving an interface to find/recall as well as create new
Fossil repositories.

I've slowly been using Fossil for more of my personal projects. The idea of the
self-contained nature of Fossil as well as the ease to host them remotely
appeals to me a lot, but I wanted a nice interface for making and navigating to
the various repositories I've got. There's already the great
[Chisel](https://chiselapp.com/) but I enjoy reinventing wheels, and was
looking to build something which I could eventually integrate additional
tooling into, such as a CI/CD pipeline and centralized auth.
