**TL;DR** PDNRF, aka Please Do **NOT** Rob Fish, is a small photo sharing and
organizing site for myself; Born out of the need to use the joke domain
`rob.fish` for *anything*.

PDNRF handles optimizing photos, converting videos to gifs (and gifs to videos)
to ease sharing across a variety of mediums and provides some basic tag and
date range searching, along with exposing a description for shared photos. I
tried to design it in a way to help me facilitate sharing screenshots without
needing scp hacks and letting me do so from mobile devices as well.

## Technology
- Ruby, Roda, Sqlite, with some Stimulus.js and Tailwind CSS bundled together with Vite.js
- VIPS and Ffmpeg handle the images and videos/gifs

## Neat Details
- Video transcoding has issues at the moment because PDNRF eats the docker
containers memory. It's not ideal.
