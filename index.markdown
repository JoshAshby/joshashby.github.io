# Hello!

I'm [Ashby](/about/), a [software dev](https://github.com/JoshAshby) but occasionally I [take photos](/photos/) or worse [write](/posts/).

<small>Looking to get a hold of me? Shoot me an email at `me (at) joshashby.com`, find me on the [libera irc network](https://libera.chat/) as JoshAshby or ping me on Mastodon as `@ashby@octodon.social`.</small>
