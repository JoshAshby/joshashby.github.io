slug: duckware
cover:
  description: Duckware is a QA and developers dream. It records events happening on a webpage, ranging from clicks to websocket data and network requests and allows packaging it up with timestamped screen recordings to send over to developers to help hunt bugs.

Duckware is a new and evolving project for me, so this page should be considered
"Under Construction" as new features get built out and the extension gets more
polish.

Currently Duckware:
- Logs network (including websocket frames) requests
  - It'll capture JSON request/response bodies
- Logs user interactions with the recording webpage
  - Clicks, keyboard events, navigations
- Logs console messages from the webpage
- Allows you to record multiple screen captures per session
- Saves the log and all screen captures into a zip that can be passed to
  another Duckware user

In Progress Features:
- Logging Worker and window.postMessage/onMessage events
- Better control over the screen capture, including audio muting
- Arbitrary file upload
- Loading/viewing reports generated by another Duckware user
  - Including play back of recorded user interactions

## Technology
- Svelte, Typescript, Daisy UI/Tailwind CSS all bundled together with Vite.js

## Neat Details
- Like Broom did before it, Duckware pushed the boundaries for my RPC framework
  and was even responsible for some bugfixes and better support in Broom!
- Duckware is my first foray into the media APIs in the browser
