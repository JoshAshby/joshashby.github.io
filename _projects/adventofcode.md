# 2023
**Technology:** Swift 5.9

[Solution code](https://bones.isin.space/user/JoshAshby/repository/AdventOfCode/dir?ci=tip&name=2023)

December of 2023 turned out to be a crazy time with travel to the UK, sickness
and the typical holiday chaos. As a result I only got through day 3 before
running out of time. One day I might return and finish the year, but I ended up
spending most of my free time building out a whole [Parser
Combinator](https://bones.isin.space/user/JoshAshby/repository/AdventOfCode/file?name=2023/Sources/Parsers/ParserCombinators.swift&ci=tip)
library (for the second time) that I hope I might be able to make use of in
future years and other projects.

The parser combinator library gave me the opportunity to also work with
[DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/) for the first time, using
[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), as well as defining and using
custom operators in Swift so it still resulted in a lot of learning, even if
most of it didn't come from the actual solutions.

# 2022
**Technology:** Swift 5.7

[Solution code](https://bones.isin.space/user/JoshAshby/repository/AdventOfCode/dir?ci=tip&name=2022)

This year I started trying to [blog about my solutions]({% link
_posts/2022-12-01-aoc-2022.md %}), although I only made it to day 8 before I
admittely ran out of steam. In addition to some technical writing experience, I
learned a lot about Swift outside of iOS/macOS app development and really fell
in love with the language.

# 2021
**Technology:** OCaml 4.13.1

[Solution code](https://bones.isin.space/user/JoshAshby/repository/AdventOfCode/dir?ci=tip&name=2021)

My first year actively participating. I learned a lot about OCaml and more
generally functional programming, as my only experience with FP up to this
point had been with Elixir.

Highlights from this year include writing a [Parser
Combinator](https://bones.isin.space/user/JoshAshby/repository/AdventOfCode/file?name=2021/lib/parsers.ml&ci=tip)
library modeled after [Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom).
