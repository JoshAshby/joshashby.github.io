I'm a quick and enthusiastic learner on new technologies and code bases and I'm passionate about continuous growth. I'm experienced with being in knowledge leadership roles. I am comfortable working collaboratively, remotely or on my own.

**Primary Technologies:** Elixir/Phoenix, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS, Svelte, Redis, SQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite, Elasticsearch, CSS

**Comfortable Tools & Platforms:** Git, Fossil-SCM, Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean

<h3>Notable Work</h3>
* As a consultant and contractor, I've helped a number of teams refactor and architect large TypeScript/React and Elixir/Phoenix code bases to reduce operational costs, risk of mistakes, and increase developer speed and product alignment.
* I architected and developed an extensive in-house ETL framework in Ruby, that transformed data from a number of sources including Elasticsearch, Postgres, Google Sheets, External APIs and Redis into a data lake stored in AWS Redshift.
* I've developed a browser extension for Chrome which makes a given tab to use a virtual cookie store for a marketing and customer success company to manage multiple client accounts at once. It also provides a number of additional tools for generating links with pre-set UTM parameters as well as storing and copying to the clipboard custom text shortcuts.
* I've developed a number of browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome, notably one that simplifies the process of scraping data from a website into CSV and JSON formats without needing complex pipelines. Website: https://slothby.club/broom
