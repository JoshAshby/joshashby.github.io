  - "I architected and developed an extensive in-house ETL framework in Ruby, that transformed data from a number of sources including Elasticsearch, Postgres, Google Sheets, External APIs and Redis into a data lake stored in AWS Redshift."
  #- "I developed a browser extension for Chrome which makes a given tab to use a virtual cookie store for a marketing and customer success company to manage multiple client accounts at once. It also provides a number of additional tools for generating links with pre-set UTM parameters as well as storing and copying to the clipboard custom text shortcuts."

    highlights:
      - "Maintained a Dagster and DTB powered Data Pipeline working against Snowflake and AWS resources."
      - "Discovered and implemented optimizations for an expensive data model, which reduced build times from 6 hours to 20 minutes. This cut our database compute costs by over $30,000 per year and greatly improved the developer experience."
      - "Designed a centralized, uniform strategy and tooling for ingesting external, multi-formatted insurance data using Snowflake Snowpipes and Parquet files, reducing the time and effort required to operationalize new data from our partners from a week to 45 minutes, while increasing confidence in the data's integrity."
      - "Lead an initiative to consolidate a business critical identification service out of an unmaintained Ruby on Rails app and into our existing Python/Dagster project. This increased the operational speed and accuracy of identifying and correcting problematic duplicates."
      - "Supported a React Native mobile app project, with a focus on a ReactJS administrative panel and NodeJS GraphQL API."

    highlights:
      - "Implemented a workflow for migrating complex, dynamically generated forms out of a deprecated Meteor app's MongoDB database and into a Postgres database. Additionally, I helped build an administration panel in React to author new forms, and implemented Elixir modules to render them on a GraphQL endpoint for consumption by a separate React app. This reduced the client's time required to onboard new contracts from two weeks to a few hours."
      - Maintained four Elixir/Phoenix projects, including a greenfield application, and one open-source library for integrating Elasticsearch with Ecto models.
      - Maintained and implemented new features in two React projects, one of which was a React Native mobile application.

It also provided a number of additional tools such as generating links with preset UTM parameters, and storing/copying custom text shortcuts to the clipboard.
      - Migrated and modernized a PHP 5/Drupal/MySQL project to Ruby on Rails 6 with Postgres.
