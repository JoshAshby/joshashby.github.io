I've always been interested in the lower levels of computers, the back dungeons and hidden alley ways that make up the modern computing experience. This was one of the leading points for jumping into electronics and microcontrollers as a kid, and later going into a computer engineering course to learn the source of the dark magic behind the little ceramic encased chips that are ubiquitous in todays world. These days it manifests as a number of saved or bookmarked compiler and interpreter books, introduction sites, tutorials and more all saved up in some unending backlog that might as well be magical in itself.
